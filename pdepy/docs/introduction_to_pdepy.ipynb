    "- User Friendly  \n",
    "Whatever type of PDE the user wants to solve, all he/she needs to do is to set the boundary condition, plug the PDE into the solver, and finally call the function **solve()**. No need to memorize tons of APIs, since the solver will automatically detect the type of the PDE, whether its domain is regular, etc., and select the appropriate algorithm for you.  \n",

    "It's impossible that the library will always meet all needs from its users, e.g., higher-order differential operators, more accurate approximation, etc. So when I was designing this library, I made it extremely easy to add new operators, or to modify the existing numerical stencils.  \n",

    "Here is a time-dependent operator example. The implicit stencil is for Crank-Nicolson method, while the explicit stencil is for the explicit method. User can add new time-dependent operators in the manner of this class.\n",
